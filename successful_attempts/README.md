## Successful Attempts

⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️  this is not real "bugs" or "vulns", it's just,  successful (according to me myself) attempts. This is not to be seen as "real vulns that exploits stuff", if I ever find any vuln I would not publish it, I would report it.


for each "POC? -> Available" please see the directory "POCS" with the numbers 0,1,2,<sub>i = n<sub/>
| NAME   | DIFFICULTY<sub>1,2,...,10</sub>  |  LEVEL <sub>1,2,...,10</sub> | POC Availble |
