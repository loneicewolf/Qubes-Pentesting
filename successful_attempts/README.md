## Successful Attempts

⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️  this is not real "bugs" or "vulns", it's just,  successful (according to me myself) attempts. This is not to be seen as "real vulns that exploits stuff", if I ever find any vuln I would not publish it, I would report it.

for each "POC? -> Available" please see the directory "POCS" with the numbers 0,1,2,<sub>i = n<sub/>
| NAME   | DIFFICULTY<sub>1,2,...,10</sub>  |  LEVEL <sub>1,2,...,10</sub> | POC Availble |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| 0 Screenshot Escape |  Easy | 1 | Available |
| A | B |   N=` ` | ` ` |
| A | B |   N=` ` | ` ` |
| A | B |   N=` ` | ` ` |

-  `0 // E.g the screenshot escape does not mean it can escape and take a photo of something else, it actually becomes white, so you can't use "qube one to screenshot qube two" (at least not what I have experienced)`
